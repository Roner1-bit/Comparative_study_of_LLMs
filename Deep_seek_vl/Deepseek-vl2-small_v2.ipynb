      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, well-defined contrast-enhancing tumor in the left frontal lobe. The tumor was highly vascular, as evidenced by the significant contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images. The T2/FLAIR images showed a large, hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema. The ADC map indicated restricted diffusion, consistent with a glioblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately delineated the tumor, capturing the entire extent of the glioblastoma. The segmentation was precise, with clear boundaries separating the tumor from the surrounding brain tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor was accessible and well-circumscribed, allowing for a complete resection. The gross total resection (GTR) was achieved, and the margins were clear of tumor tissue. The patient underwent a standard surgical procedure, and the resection was performed without complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient had a significant history of hypertension and diabetes, which were well-controlled preoperatively. The patient's performance status was good, with a KPS of 70. The preoperative contrast-enhanced tumor volume was 65.82 cm³, and the T2/FLAIR abnormality was 112.88 cm³. The extent of resection was 100%, and the resection was performed as a gross total resection (GTR).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Postoperative imaging (CT or MRI) to assess for any residual tumor or complications.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up with MRI to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) as recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade is 4, and the IDH status is wild type (wt), which are favorable prognostic factors. The patient's age and performance status are also favorable. The extent of resection and adjuvant therapy further enhance the prognosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI every 3 months for the first year post-surgery.\n",
      "- MRI every 6 months for the second year post-surgery.\n",
      "- Annual follow-up with clinical examination and imaging.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits a heterogeneous signal intensity on T1-weighted images, with a significant contrast enhancement on T1-weighted post-contrast images. The T2-weighted images show a slightly hyperintense lesion, and the FLAIR images reveal a hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema. The ADC images show restricted diffusion, indicating a solid mass. The segmentation masks confirm the presence of a large, irregularly shaped tumor with clear delineation from surrounding brain tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately outline the tumor, showing a well-circumscribed mass with a clear boundary. The segmentation appears to capture the entire extent of the tumor, including any potential satellite lesions. The segmentation is consistent across all sequences, indicating a reliable identification of the tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is located in the frontal lobe, which is a common site for glioblastoma. The tumor's size and location suggest that a gross total resection (GTR) is feasible. The preoperative contrast-enhancing volume is large, indicating a significant mass effect. The extent of resection is 100%, and the tumor is well-circumscribed, which is ideal for surgical resection.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient is a 65-year-old male with a glioblastoma (WHO grade 4, IDH mutant). The tumor is located in the frontal lobe and is well-circumscribed, allowing for a gross total resection. The patient has a good performance status (KPS 80) and a large contrast-enhancing tumor volume (103.21 cm³). The preoperative T2/FLAIR abnormality is 36.29 cm³, indicating the presence of edema. The patient underwent a GTR, and adjuvant therapy includes radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- The patient has undergone a gross total resection (GTR) of the glioblastoma.\n",
      "- Adjuvant therapy with RT and TMZ is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging is essential to monitor for any signs of recurrence or progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade 4 and IDH mutant status are associated with a poor prognosis. However, the extent of resection (100%) and the patient's good performance status (KPS 80) are positive prognostic factors. The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging (MRI) every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, and annually thereafter.\n",
      "- Annual CT scans to monitor for any signs of recurrence or progression.\n",
      "- Neurological examination and cognitive function assessment every 6 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient's age and sex are not relevant to the current case.\n",
      "- The patient's performance status (KPS) is excellent, which is beneficial for postoperative recovery and adjuvant therapy.\n",
      "- The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive outcome.\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images (T1) reveal a bright, enhancing tumor with a well-circumscribed border. The T2-weighted images (T2) show a slightly hyperintense lesion with a well-defined edge. The FLAIR images (FLAIR) demonstrate a hyperintense lesion with a clear boundary, indicating the presence of edema or necrosis. The ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, suggesting a solid mass. The segmentation masks (Seg) confirm the presence of a tumor in the left frontal lobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately delineate the tumor, showing a well-circumscribed mass in the left frontal lobe. The segmentation is consistent across all sequences, indicating a homogeneous tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is well-circumscribed and appears to be accessible for surgical resection. The extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, indicating a complete resection. The tumor is located in the frontal lobe, which is a common site for glioblastoma. The preoperative contrast-enhancing tumor volume (CEV) is 103.21 cm³, and the T2/FLAIR abnormality volume is 36.29 cm³, suggesting a significant tumor burden.\n",

      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient is a 65-year-old male with a glioblastoma (WHO grade 4, IDH mutant) who underwent a gross total resection (GTR) surgery. The tumor was well-circumscribed and accessible for resection. The patient has a good performance status (KPS 80) and a high extent of resection (EOR 100%). The patient is scheduled for adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Adjuvant Therapy:** The patient should receive RT and TMZ as adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n",
      "2. **Follow-Up:** Regular follow-up MRI and clinical examination are essential to monitor for any signs of recurrence.\n",
      "3. **Prognostic Considerations:** The patient's prognosis is favorable due to the complete resection and adjuvant therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "1. **Follow-Up MRI:** Monthly MRI scans for the first year post-surgery.\n",
      "2. **Clinical Examination:** Regular clinical examination to monitor for any neurological deficits.\n",
      "3. **Adjuvant Therapy:** Adherence to RT and TMZ therapy as prescribed.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits a heterogeneous signal intensity on T1-weighted images, with a significant contrast enhancement on T1c images, indicating a highly vascular tumor. The T2-weighted images show a slightly hypointense lesion, while the FLAIR images reveal a hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema. The ADC images show restricted diffusion, suggesting a necrotic core. The segmentation masks confirm the presence of a large, irregularly shaped tumor with a well-defined boundary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately delineate the tumor, capturing its irregular shape and extent. The segmentation appears to include both the necrotic core and the surrounding edematous tissue, which is consistent with the heterogeneous signal intensity observed in the imaging sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is located in the frontal lobe, which is a common site for glioblastoma. The extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, indicating a complete surgical removal. The tumor's vascular nature, as evidenced by the contrast enhancement, suggests that careful surgical planning is necessary to minimize the risk of bleeding. The presence of edema and necrosis may require additional surgical techniques, such as tumor debulking, to ensure complete resection.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing, highly vascular glioblastoma located in the frontal lobe. The tumor was resected gross total, and the histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of glioblastoma with a WHO grade of 4 and an IDH status of wild type. The patient's performance status was good, and he received adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide. The patient has shown significant progression-free survival and overall survival, indicating the effectiveness of the treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging is recommended to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Surveillance CT scans should be performed every 3-6 months for the first year, then annually thereafter.\n",
      "- The patient should be counseled on the potential for cognitive and motor deficits due to the tumor's location.\n",
      "- The patient should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences any neurological symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade and IDH status are favorable prognostic factors. The complete resection and adjuvant therapy have contributed to the patient's good survival outcomes. However, the presence of edema and necrosis may indicate a higher risk of recurrence, and close monitoring is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging every 3-6 months for the first year, then annually thereafter.\n",
      "- Surveillance CT scans every 3-6 months for the first year, then annually thereafter.\n",
      "- Neurological examination every 3-6 months for the first year, then annually thereafter.\n",
      "- Cognitive and motor function assessments every 3-6 months for the first year, then annually thereafter.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes, which should be managed to minimize the risk of complications.\n",
      "- The patient should be advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities to prevent injury.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits a heterogeneous signal intensity on T1-weighted images, with a significant portion enhancing after contrast administration. On T2-weighted images, the lesion appears hyperintense, and on FLAIR images, it shows a slightly hypointense signal. The ADC map indicates restricted diffusion, suggesting a solid mass. The segmentation mask confirms the presence of a large, irregularly shaped tumor with clear boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately delineates the tumor, capturing its irregular shape and extent. The mask shows a well-defined boundary, which is crucial for surgical planning and radiation therapy. The segmentation also highlights the presence of necrosis and areas of hemorrhage within the tumor, which are important for understanding the tumor's biology and potential response to treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor's location in the frontal lobe and its size (103.21 cm³) suggest that a gross total resection (GTR) is feasible. The tumor's location and the need for a GTR indicate that the surgical approach should be carefully planned to avoid damage to critical brain structures. The preoperative contrast-enhancing volume (14.54 cm³) and T2/FLAIR abnormality (20.94 cm³) suggest that the tumor is highly vascular and may have a high risk of recurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe, which was confirmed to be a glioblastoma (WHO grade 4, IDH mutant). The patient had a preoperative KPS of 80 and a contrast-enhanced tumor volume of 103.21 cm³. The extent of resection was 100%, and the patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR). Adjuvant therapy included radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). The patient's progression-free survival (PFS) was 649 days, and overall survival (OS) was 736 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- **Follow-Up:** Regular follow-up imaging is essential to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- **Adjuvant Therapy:** Continue with RT and TMZ as per the current protocol.\n",
      "- **Neurocognitive Monitoring:** Regular neurocognitive assessments are recommended to monitor for any cognitive decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade 4 and IDH mutant status are associated with a poor prognosis. However, the extent of resection (100%) and the patient's age and performance status (KPS 80) are favorable prognostic factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- **Imaging:** Regular MRI scans every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, and annually thereafter.\n",
      "- **Neurocognitive Assessments:** Monthly neurocognitive assessments for the first year, then every 3 months for the next 2 years, and annually thereafter.\n",
      "- **Follow-Up Appointments:** Regular follow-up appointments with the oncologist and neurosurgeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient's KPS at the time of surgery was 80, which is a good prognostic factor.\n",
      "- The patient's age (65) and sex (male) are also favorable prognostic factors.\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, well-defined contrast-enhancing tumor in the left frontal lobe. The tumor was located in a region that was accessible for surgical resection. The preoperative T2/FLAIR images showed a significant abnormality, which was confirmed by the postoperative histopathological examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks at the bottom row of the images accurately delineated the tumor, showing a clear boundary and internal structures. The segmentation was consistent across all sequences, indicating a well-defined tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor was completely resected with a gross total resection (GTR). The surgical approach was necessary due to the size and location of the tumor, which was causing significant mass effect and midline shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient underwent a successful surgical resection of a glioblastoma. The tumor was completely resected, and the patient is currently recovering well. The patient's KPS is 80, indicating good overall health.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue postoperative radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) as adjuvant therapy.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up MRI to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Neurological assessment to monitor for any neurological deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade is 4, and the IDH status is wild type (wt), which are favorable prognostic factors. The extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, and the patient is undergoing adjuvant therapy, which further improves the prognosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI every 3 months for the first year.\n",
      "- MRI every 6 months for the second year.\n",
      "- Annual follow-up thereafter.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits a heterogeneous signal intensity on T1-weighted images (T1), with a slightly enhancing component on T1-weighted post-contrast images (T1c). The T2-weighted images (T2) show a hyperintense lesion with a well-defined border. The FLAIR images (FLAIR) reveal a hyperintense lesion with a surrounding edema. The ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, indicating a solid tumor. The segmentation mask (Seg) delineates the tumor with high accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately outlines the tumor, capturing its entire extent. The segmentation is consistent across all slices, indicating a well-defined tumor boundary. The segmentation includes the enhancing and non-enhancing components of the tumor, which is crucial for surgical planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is located in the frontal lobe, which is a critical area for motor and cognitive functions. The extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, indicating a complete resection. The tumor is well-circumscribed, and the segmentation mask confirms the absence of residual tumor tissue. The surgical approach should focus on preserving as much healthy brain tissue as possible while ensuring complete resection of the tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing glioblastoma, which is a high-grade, aggressive brain tumor. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) with adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). The patient has shown significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) since the surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue regular follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Regular neurological assessments to evaluate for any neurological deficits.\n",
      "- Consider adjuvant therapy as indicated by the clinical team.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade 4 and IDH mutant status are associated with a poor prognosis. However, the complete resection and adjuvant therapy have improved the patient's survival outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI every 3 months for the first year.\n",
      "- MRI every 6 months for the next 2 years.\n",
      "- Annual neurological assessments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits a heterogeneous signal intensity on T1-weighted images, with a significant portion enhancing after contrast administration. On T2-weighted images, the lesion appears hyperintense, and on FLAIR images, it shows a slightly hypointense signal. The ADC map indicates restricted diffusion, suggesting a solid component. The segmentation mask confirms the presence of a large, irregularly shaped tumor with clear delineation from surrounding brain tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately outlines the tumor, capturing its irregular borders and the extent of the abnormal tissue. The mask shows a high degree of overlap with the T2/FLAIR abnormalities, indicating the presence of a necrotic core and surrounding edema.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor's location and size, as well as its aggressive nature, necessitate a complete resection. The gross total resection (GTR) was achieved, and the extent of resection (EOR) was 100.0%. The tumor's location in the frontal lobe and its potential impact on motor and cognitive functions require careful consideration during surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing, high-grade glioblastoma. The preoperative imaging and clinical data indicate a well-defined, hyperintense lesion with significant contrast enhancement. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) with a high EOR, and adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide were planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Postoperative MRI should be performed to assess for residual tumor and any signs of recurrence.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up with MRI and clinical examination to monitor for any signs of progression.\n",
      "- Adjuvant therapy (RT + TMZ) should be initiated as planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade 4 and IDH mutant status are associated with a poor prognosis. However, the complete resection and adjuvant therapy may improve survival outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI every 3 months for the first year post-surgery.\n",
      "- MRI every 6 months for the second year post-surgery.\n",
      "- Annual clinical examination and neurological assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits a heterogeneous signal intensity on T1-weighted images, with a significant contrast enhancement on T1c images, indicating a highly vascular tumor. The T2-weighted images show a slightly hypointense lesion, and the FLAIR images reveal a hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema. The ADC images show restricted diffusion, and the segmentation masks confirm the presence of a large, irregularly shaped tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately delineate the tumor, showing a well-circumscribed mass with clear boundaries. The segmentation indicates a high degree of tumor heterogeneity, with areas of necrosis and cystic components. The segmentation also highlights the presence of surrounding edema, which is consistent with the T2/FLAIR findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The surgical resection was extensive, with a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor. The extent of resection was 100%, and the tumor was completely removed. The surgical margins were clear, and no residual tumor tissue was detected. The patient underwent a GTR, which is the standard of care for glioblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing, highly vascular glioblastoma. The preoperative imaging and clinical data indicated a high-grade tumor with significant edema and restricted diffusion. The patient underwent a GTR, and the resection was complete. The patient is currently on adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide therapy as per the standard treatment protocol.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Consider additional imaging modalities, such as PET-CT, to assess for metabolic activity and potential metastasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's prognosis is guarded due to the high-grade nature of the tumor and the presence of significant edema. The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is within the expected range for glioblastoma patients treated with RT and TMZ.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Schedule follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess for recurrence.\n",
      "- Consider additional imaging modalities, such as PET-CT, to monitor for metastasis.\n",
      "- Regular clinical follow-up to assess for any neurological deficits or other complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient's KPS was 80 preoperatively, which is within the acceptable range for glioblastoma patients.\n",
      "- The patient's T2/FLAIR abnormality was 36.29 cm³, which is within the expected range for glioblastoma.\n",
      "- The patient's EOR was 100%, indicating a complete resection.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits a heterogeneous signal intensity on T1-weighted images (T1), with a slightly enhancing mass on T1-weighted post-contrast images (T1c). The T2-weighted images (T2) show a hyperintense lesion with a well-defined border. The FLAIR images (FLAIR) reveal a hyperintense lesion with a clear boundary, indicating the presence of edema or necrosis. The ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, suggesting a solid mass. The segmentation mask (Seg) delineates the tumor with high accuracy, capturing the entire extent of the lesion.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately outlines the tumor, indicating a well-defined and homogeneous mass. The segmentation captures the entire tumor volume, including any potential enhancing regions. The segmentation is consistent across all slices, suggesting a well-defined tumor structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is located in the frontal lobe, which is a critical area for motor and cognitive functions. The extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, indicating a complete surgical removal of the tumor. The gross total resection (GTR) is performed, which is essential for achieving a good prognosis in glioblastoma patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient is a 65-year-old male with a glioblastoma (WHO grade 4, IDH mutant) who underwent a gross total resection (GTR) surgery. The tumor was well-defined and hyperintense on various MRI sequences, with restricted diffusion on ADC images. The patient has a good performance status (KPS 80) and a high extent of resection (EOR 100%). Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) are planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Post-surgical follow-up with regular imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Adjuvant RT and TMZ therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n",
      "- Regular neurological assessments to monitor for any neurological deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade 4 and IDH mutant status are associated with a poor prognosis. However, the complete resection (EOR 100%) and adjuvant therapy (RT + TMZ) are positive prognostic factors. The patient's age and performance status are also favorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI every 3 months for the first year post-surgery.\n",
      "- CT or PET scans every 6 months for the first year post-surgery.\n",
      "- Regular neurological assessments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive outcome.\n",
      "- The progression-free survival (PFS) is 649 days, indicating a good response to adjuvant therapy.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits a heterogeneous signal intensity on T1-weighted images, with a significant contrast enhancement on T1c images, indicating a highly vascular tumor. The T2-weighted images show a slightly hyperintense lesion, while the FLAIR images reveal a more pronounced hyperintensity, suggesting the presence of edema or necrosis. The ADC images show restricted diffusion, consistent with a glioblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks at the bottom row of the images delineate the tumor with high accuracy, capturing the entire extent of the lesion. The segmentation appears to include both the enhancing and non-enhancing parts of the tumor, which is crucial for surgical planning and radiation therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is located in the frontal lobe, which is a critical area for motor and cognitive functions. The extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, indicating a complete resection. The tumor's location and the high vascularity suggest that a gross total resection (GTR) was performed. The Adjuvant Therapy of RT + TMZ is appropriate for this high-grade glioblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing glioblastoma, as evidenced by the contrast-enhanced imaging. The patient's performance status (KPS) was 80, which is relatively good, and the tumor volume was substantial at 103.21 cm³. The extent of resection was 100%, and the patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR). The Adjuvant Therapy of RT + TMZ is standard for glioblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue monitoring for any signs of recurrence or progression.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging to assess the response to Adjuvant Therapy.\n",
      "- Consider additional imaging modalities such as PET-CT for further staging and monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade is 4, and the IDH status is mutant, which are unfavorable prognostic factors. However, the patient's performance status (KPS) is 80, and the extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, which are positive prognostic factors. The Adjuvant Therapy of RT + TMZ is standard, and the patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging every 3 months for the first year.\n",
      "- Annual follow-up imaging thereafter.\n",
      "- Consider additional imaging modalities such as PET-CT for further staging and monitoring.\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images reveal a large, irregular mass with heterogeneous enhancement. The T1c images confirm the presence of a hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema. The T2-weighted images show a large, hyperintense lesion with a well-defined border. The FLAIR images demonstrate a large, hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema and mass effect. The ADC images show restricted diffusion, indicating a solid mass. The segmentation masks confirm the presence of a large, irregular mass in the left frontal lobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately delineate the tumor, showing a well-defined, irregular mass in the left frontal lobe. The segmentation is consistent across all sequences, indicating a well-defined tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The surgical resection was extensive, with a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor. The extent of resection (EOR) was 100%, and the resection was performed with clear margins. The tumor was well-circumscribed, and there was no evidence of residual tumor.\n",

      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, irregular mass in the left frontal lobe, which was confirmed by MRI imaging. The tumor was well-defined, and the resection was extensive, with a gross total resection (GTR) and clear margins. The patient had a good performance status (KPS) and was able to undergo surgery. The adjuvant therapy included radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), which were well-tolerated. The patient has shown good progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue adjuvant therapy with RT and TMZ.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up with MRI imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Consider additional imaging studies, such as PET-CT, to assess for metastatic disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient has a good prognosis, with a high extent of resection (EOR) and clear margins. The WHO grade is 4, and the IDH status is wild-type (wt), which are favorable prognostic factors. The patient has shown good PFS and OS outcomes, indicating a favorable prognosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up with MRI imaging every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2 years.\n",
      "- Consider additional imaging studies, such as PET-CT, every 6 months for the first year, then every 12 months for the next 2 years.\n",
      "- Regular clinical follow-up to assess for any signs of recurrence or progression.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits significant contrast enhancement, indicating a high vascularity. The T2-weighted images reveal a heterogeneous mass with areas of necrosis and edema. The FLAIR images show a clear boundary between the tumor and the surrounding brain tissue, with the tumor appearing hyperintense. The ADC images suggest restricted diffusion, consistent with the presence of a solid mass. The segmentation masks confirm the presence of a large, irregularly shaped tumor with a well-defined margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately delineate the tumor, showing a clear boundary between the tumor and the surrounding brain tissue. The segmentation appears to capture the entire extent of the tumor, including any areas of necrosis or edema. The segmentation is consistent across all sequences, indicating a well-defined tumor structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The surgical resection was extensive, with a gross total resection (GTR) achieved. The tumor was well-circumscribed, and the surgical margins were clear. The extent of resection was 100%, and the tumor was completely removed. The surgical approach was necessary to ensure complete removal of the tumor, given its size and aggressive nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe, which was confirmed to be a glioblastoma. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) and received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). The patient has shown significant improvement in both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), with PFS at 649 days and OS at 736 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue regular follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Regular neurological assessments to monitor for any neurological deficits.\n",
      "- Consider adjuvant therapy as indicated by the clinical team.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade 4 glioblastoma and IDH mutant status are associated with a poor prognosis. However, the patient's excellent surgical resection and adjuvant therapy have contributed to a favorable outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI every 3 months for the first year.\n",
      "- MRI every 6 months for the next 2 years.\n",
      "- Annual follow-up with clinical examination and neurological assessment.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images provided show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere. The T1-weighted image (T1) reveals a well-circumscribed mass with a heterogeneous signal intensity, suggesting the presence of both necrotic and neoplastic tissue. The T1-weighted contrast-enhanced image (T1c) highlights the enhancing nature of the tumor, indicating active blood supply and potential vascularity. The T2-weighted image (T2) shows a hyperintense lesion, consistent with the presence of edema or necrosis. The FLAIR image (FLAIR) further confirms the hyperintensity, with the lesion appearing as a bright area against the darker background of the brain parenchyma. The ADC map (ADC) shows restricted diffusion, which is typical for glioblastoma. The segmentation mask (Seg) delineates the tumor's extent, confirming a large, well-circumscribed mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The gross total resection (GTR) was achieved with a complete removal of the tumor, as indicated by the 100% extent of resection. The tumor's location and size suggest that a comprehensive surgical approach was necessary to ensure complete resection. The postoperative images (not provided) would typically show any residual tumor or complications, but based on the provided images, the surgical outcome appears to be successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, hyperintense lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere, consistent with a glioblastoma. The preoperative imaging and surgical findings confirm a well-circumscribed, high-grade tumor. The patient's performance status (KPS) was 80, indicating good physical condition for surgery. The tumor's IDH status is wild-type (wt), which is a common subtype for glioblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- The patient has undergone a gross total resection (GTR) of the glioblastoma.\n",
      "- Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging and clinical monitoring are essential to detect any signs of recurrence or complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade 4 and IDH status (wt) are significant prognostic factors. Glioblastomas with these characteristics typically have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of around 12-15 months. However, the patient's age (65) and overall survival (OS) of 736 days (approximately 2 years) are encouraging, suggesting that the patient may have benefited from the adjuvant therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up MRI scans at 3-month intervals to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Clinical examination and neurological assessment every 3 months.\n",
      "- CT scans of the chest and abdomen every 6 months to rule out metastasis.\n",
      "- Regular blood tests to monitor for any signs of toxicity from RT and TMZ.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient's KPS was 80, indicating good physical condition for surgery.\n",
      "- The patient's OS of 736 days is a positive outcome, suggesting that the adjuvant therapy has been effective.\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, well-defined contrast-enhancing tumor in the left frontal lobe. The tumor was located in a region that was accessible for surgical resection. The preoperative imaging showed a significant T2/FLAIR abnormality, indicating the presence of a high-grade tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks at the bottom row of the images accurately delineated the tumor, showing a clear boundary that encompassed the entire tumor mass. The segmentation was consistent across all slices, indicating a well-defined tumor structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor was resected completely, with a gross total resection (GTR) achieved. The extent of resection was 100%, and the surgical margins were clear, suggesting no residual tumor tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient underwent a successful surgical resection of a glioblastoma located in the left frontal lobe. The tumor was well-defined and accessible, allowing for a complete resection. The patient's preoperative imaging and segmentation analysis indicated a high-grade tumor with a significant T2/FLAIR abnormality.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Postoperative MRI scans should be performed to assess for any residual tumor or complications.\n",
      "- Adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide should be initiated as per the standard treatment protocol.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to monitor for any signs of recurrence or progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade 4 and IDH wt status are associated with a poor prognosis. However, the complete resection and adjuvant therapy may improve the overall survival and progression-free survival outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI scans at 3 months post-surgery to assess for any residual tumor.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up appointments every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months thereafter.\n",
      "- Adjuvant therapy should be continued as per the standard treatment protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient's KPS was 70 preoperatively, which is a good indication of her overall health and ability to undergo surgery.\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits a heterogeneous signal intensity on T1-weighted images, with a significant portion enhancing after contrast administration. On T2-weighted images, the lesion appears hyperintense, and on FLAIR images, it shows a ring-enhancing pattern. The ADC map indicates restricted diffusion, consistent with a glioblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately delineates the tumor, capturing the entire extent of the lesion. The segmentation appears to include both the enhancing and non-enhancing parts of the tumor, which is crucial for surgical planning and radiation therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is well-circumscribed and appears to be accessible for gross total resection. The extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, and the tumor is located in a region that is anatomically complex but manageable. The patient's preoperative KPS is 80, indicating good overall health, which is favorable for surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing glioblastoma, as evidenced by the contrast-enhanced imaging. The tumor's aggressive nature is reflected in the high WHO grade and IDH mutation status. Despite the aggressive tumor, the patient's preoperative KPS is 80, and the extent of resection is 100%, which is a positive factor for surgical outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Surgical Planning:** The surgical team should proceed with a gross total resection (GTR) to ensure complete removal of the tumor.\n",
      "2. **Adjuvant Therapy:** The patient will receive radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) as adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n",
      "3. **Follow-Up:** Regular follow-up imaging and clinical monitoring are essential to detect any signs of recurrence or progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive prognostic factor. The progression-free survival (PFS) is 649 days, indicating a favorable response to the initial treatment. However, the aggressive nature of the tumor and the patient's age are potential prognostic factors that should be monitored closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "1. **Imaging:** Regular follow-up MRI scans at 3-month intervals to monitor for any signs of recurrence.\n",
      "2. **Clinical Monitoring:** Regular clinical assessments to evaluate the patient's neurological status and overall health.\n",
      "3. **Adjuvant Therapy:** Continuation of RT and TMZ as per the standard treatment protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "The images reviewed include 10 slices for 5 different sequences (T1, T1c, T2, FLAIR, ADC) and the segmentation mask for the tumor. The segmentation accurately captures the tumor's extent, which is crucial for surgical planning and radiation therapy.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images (T1) reveal a large, irregular mass with a heterogeneous signal intensity. The T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images (T1c) show a significant enhancement, indicating a highly vascular tumor. The T2-weighted images (T2) show a hyperintense lesion with a well-defined border. The FLAIR images (FLAIR) show a hyperintense lesion with a clear boundary, suggesting the presence of edema or necrosis. The ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, indicating a solid mass. The segmentation masks (Seg) confirm the presence of a large, irregular mass in the left frontal lobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is located in the frontal lobe, which is a critical area for motor and cognitive functions. The tumor is well-circumscribed, and the extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, indicating a gross total resection. The tumor is highly vascular, as evidenced by the contrast enhancement. The patient's KPS is 80, which is a good prognostic factor for surgical candidates. The tumor is located in a region that is accessible for surgical resection, and the patient's overall condition is suitable for surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient is a 65-year-old male with a diagnosis of glioblastoma (WHO grade 4, IDH mutant). The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor, which was well-circumscribed and highly vascular. The patient's KPS is 80, and the tumor was located in the frontal lobe, which is a critical area for motor and cognitive functions. The patient's overall condition is suitable for surgery, and the tumor was accessible for surgical resection.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "The patient is currently recovering from surgery and is expected to have a good prognosis. The patient will require adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. The patient will also require regular follow-up imaging to monitor for any signs of recurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's prognosis is good, given the complete resection of the tumor and the patient's overall condition. The patient's KPS is 80, which is a good prognostic factor for surgical candidates. The patient's tumor is located in a region that is accessible for surgical resection, and the patient's overall condition is suitable for surgery. The patient's adjuvant therapy (RT + TMZ) will help reduce the risk of recurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "The patient will require regular follow-up imaging to monitor for any signs of recurrence. The patient will also require regular follow-up clinical assessments to monitor for any signs of neurological deficits. The patient will require regular follow-up imaging to monitor for any signs of recurrence.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images reveal a large, irregular mass with a heterogeneous signal intensity, suggesting the presence of necrosis and edema. The T1c-weighted images further enhance the lesion, indicating a high vascularity. The T2-weighted images show a hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema, and the FLAIR images reveal a hyperintense lesion with a surrounding hypointense edema. The ADC images show restricted diffusion, consistent with the presence of a tumor. The segmentation masks confirm the location and extent of the tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately delineate the tumor, showing a well-circumscribed mass with irregular borders. The segmentation indicates that the tumor occupies a significant portion of the left frontal lobe, with some extension into adjacent regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The surgical resection was extensive, with a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor. The extent of resection (EOR) was 100%, and the tumor was completely removed. The surgical margins were clear, and no residual tumor tissue was detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe, which was confirmed to be a glioblastoma. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor, and the resection was complete with clear margins. The patient is currently on adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue adjuvant RT and TMZ therapy as per the standard treatment protocol.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Neurological evaluation to assess for any cognitive or motor deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade is 4, and the IDH status is wild-type (wt). The patient has a good performance status (KPS 80) and a high extent of resection (EOR 100%). The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, and progression-free survival (PFS) is 649 days. These factors suggest a favorable prognosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2 years.\n",
      "- Neurological evaluation every 6 months for the first year, then annually thereafter.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images reveal a large, irregular mass with a heterogeneous signal intensity, suggesting the presence of necrosis and edema. The T1c-weighted images further enhance the lesion, indicating a high vascularity. The T2-weighted images show a hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema, and the FLAIR images reveal a hyperintense lesion with a surrounding hypointense edema. The ADC images show restricted diffusion, and the segmentation masks confirm the presence of a large, irregular mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately delineate the tumor, showing a well-defined boundary with surrounding edema. The segmentation is consistent across all sequences, indicating a well-defined tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is located in the frontal lobe, which is a critical area for motor and cognitive functions. The extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, indicating a complete resection. The tumor is well-circumscribed, and there is no evidence of capsular invasion or peritumoral edema. The surgical approach should be carefully planned to preserve as much brain tissue as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, irregular glioblastoma in the left frontal lobe. The tumor was well-defined on imaging, with a heterogeneous signal intensity and high vascularity. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) with a complete resection of the tumor. The postoperative imaging shows no evidence of recurrence. The patient is currently undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide as per the treatment plan.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging to monitor for any signs of recurrence.\n",
      "- Neurological evaluation to assess for any cognitive or motor deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade is 4, and the IDH status is wild-type. The extent of resection is 100%, and the patient is undergoing adjuvant therapy. The prognosis is generally poor for patients with WHO grade 4 glioblastoma, but the patient's age and overall performance status are favorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging every 3 months for the first year.\n",
      "- Annual follow-up imaging thereafter.\n",
      "- Neurological evaluation every 6 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits heterogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted images, with a significant portion of the tumor showing restricted diffusion on T2-weighted images. The FLAIR images reveal a hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema. ADC maps indicate restricted diffusion, and the segmentation mask confirms the presence of a large, irregularly shaped tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately delineates the tumor, showing a well-circumscribed mass with clear boundaries. The tumor appears to have a complex structure with multiple regions of varying intensity, consistent with a high-grade glioma.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is located in a critical area of the brain, and the extent of resection is extensive, covering nearly the entire tumor volume. The gross total resection (GTR) was achieved, and the tumor was completely removed. The surgical approach was necessary due to the tumor's size and location.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing glioblastoma, which was confirmed histopathologically. The tumor was classified as WHO grade 4 and had an IDH mutation status. The patient's performance status was good, with a KPS of 80, and the tumor volume was substantial, requiring a comprehensive surgical resection.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Post-surgery, the patient will receive adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging will be necessary to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Neurological assessments will be performed to evaluate for any post-surgical complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive prognostic factor. The WHO grade 4 and IDH mutation status are associated with a poorer prognosis, but the extent of resection and the patient's performance status are favorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI scans will be performed every 3 months for the first year post-surgery.\n",
      "- CT scans will be performed every 6 months for the first year post-surgery.\n",
      "- Neurological assessments will be conducted annually.\n",

      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient is a 70-year-old male with a diagnosis of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4, and IDH wild type. The patient underwent a near total resection (NTR) with an extent of resection (EOR) of 99.5%. The preoperative contrast-enhancing tumor volume was 63.18 cm³, and the preoperative T2/FLAIR abnormality was 64.11 cm³. The patient received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. The progression-free survival (PFS) is 56 days, and the overall survival (OS) is 90 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue monitoring for any signs of recurrence or progression.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging to assess the status of the tumor and any potential complications.\n",
      "- Consider additional imaging modalities or biopsy if symptoms or signs of recurrence arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "- The patient's overall survival (OS) is 90 days, which is within the expected range for glioblastoma patients with an IDH wild type and WHO grade 4.\n",
      "- The extent of resection (EOR) was near total, which is a positive prognostic factor.\n",
      "- Adjuvant therapy (RT + TMZ) is standard treatment and has been effective in this patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Schedule follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess for any signs of recurrence.\n",
      "- Review clinical status and symptoms at each follow-up visit.\n",
      "- Consider additional imaging or biopsy if symptoms or signs of recurrence arise.\n",
      "\n",

      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing glioblastoma, confirmed by histopathological examination. The tumor was classified as WHO grade 4, indicating a high-grade malignancy. The IDH status was wild-type (wt), which is a common subtype in glioblastoma. The patient's performance status (KPS) was 70, indicating a good physical condition for surgery. The preoperative contrast-enhanced tumor volume was 67.33 cm³, and the T2/FLAIR abnormality was 138.23 cm³, suggesting significant tumor burden. The extent of resection (EOR) was 98.0%, indicating a near-total resection. The resection was performed gross total resection (GTR), and the patient underwent adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Follow-Up Imaging:** Regular follow-up MRI scans are essential to monitor for recurrence. The first follow-up should be within 3 months post-surgery.\n",
      "2. **Adjuvant Therapy:** Continue with RT and TMZ as per the standard treatment protocol.\n",
      "3. **Neurological Monitoring:** Regular neurological assessments to monitor for any signs of neurological deficits.\n",
      "4. **Patient Education:** Educate the patient and family about the importance of follow-up and the potential for recurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient's overall survival (OS) is 287 days, which is a relatively short period. The progression-free survival (PFS) is 194 days, indicating a shorter duration before the tumor progresses. The WHO grade 4 and IDH wt status are associated with a poorer prognosis. However, the extent of resection (98.0%) and the use of adjuvant therapy (RT + TMZ) are positive prognostic factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Follow-Up MRI:** Schedule a follow-up MRI within 3 months post-surgery.\n",
      "2. **Regular Neurological Assessments:** Conduct regular neurological examinations to monitor for any signs of recurrence.\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images (T1) reveal a large, irregular mass with a heterogeneous signal intensity. The T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images (T1c) show a significant enhancement, indicating a highly vascular tumor. The T2-weighted images (T2) and FLAIR images (FLAIR) further confirm the presence of a large, hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema. The ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, consistent with a glioblastoma. The segmentation masks (Seg) accurately delineate the tumor, highlighting its irregular borders and involvement of surrounding brain tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately capture the extent of the tumor, including the core and the surrounding edema. The segmentation is consistent across all sequences, indicating a well-defined tumor. The segmentation also shows the involvement of the frontal lobe, which is consistent with the clinical presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is well-circumscribed and has a large volume, which is suitable for gross total resection (GTR). The extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, and the tumor is completely resected. The surgical approach was necessary due to the size and location of the tumor, which was causing significant mass effect and midline shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe, which was confirmed to be a glioblastoma. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) and received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). The patient has shown good progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Surveillance for any neurological symptoms due to potential residual tumor or edema.\n",
      "- Consideration of additional therapies, such as proton therapy, depending on the patient's overall health and response to current treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade is 4, and the IDH status is mutant, which are both poor prognostic factors. However, the patient's age and overall performance status (KPS) are relatively good, which may contribute to a better prognosis. The patient's PFS and OS outcomes are encouraging, suggesting that the current treatment regimen is effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images (T1) reveal a bright, irregular mass with surrounding edema. The T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images (T1c) show a significant enhancement, indicating a highly vascular tumor. The T2-weighted images (T2) show a hyperintense lesion with a well-defined border, consistent with a glioblastoma. The FLAIR images (FLAIR) show a hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema, and the ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, suggesting a high cellularity tumor. The segmentation mask (Seg) accurately delineates the tumor, confirming its extent and location.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately outlines the tumor, showing a well-defined mass in the left frontal lobe. The segmentation is consistent with the MRI images, confirming the presence and extent of the tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor, with a complete resection of the contrast-enhancing tumor volume. The extent of resection (EOR) was 100%, and the resection was performed with clear margins. The patient's preoperative KPS was 80, and the postoperative KPS was not provided, but the patient's overall survival (OS) was 736 days, indicating a favorable outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a glioblastoma, a highly aggressive primary brain tumor. The MRI images and segmentation mask confirm the diagnosis and extent of the tumor. The patient underwent a complete resection, and the postoperative course was favorable, with a long progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue regular follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Regular neurological assessments to monitor for any neurological deficits.\n",
      "- Consider adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide based on the patient's overall survival and progression-free survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade 4 glioblastoma and IDH mutant status are associated with a poor prognosis. However, the complete resection and favorable survival outcomes suggest that the patient's treatment was effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Schedule follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess for recurrence.\n",
      "- Regular neurological assessments to monitor for any neurological deficits.\n",
      "- Continue adjuvant therapy as recommended.\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images (T1) reveal a heterogeneous mass with a mix of hyperintense and hypointense areas, indicating the presence of both necrotic and neoplastic tissue. The T1c images (T1c) show contrast enhancement, suggesting a vascular component. The T2-weighted images (T2) and FLAIR images (FLAIR) further confirm the presence of a hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema. The ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, indicating a solid mass. The segmentation mask (Seg) delineates the tumor with high accuracy, capturing the entire extent of the lesion.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately outlines the tumor, capturing its entire extent and ensuring that no residual tumor tissue is left behind. The segmentation is precise, with clear boundaries that differentiate the tumor from surrounding brain tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The gross total resection (GTR) was achieved with a complete removal of the tumor, as indicated by the EOR of 100%. The extent of resection was extensive, covering the entire tumor volume. The surgical approach was well-planned, and the resection margins were clear, reducing the risk of recurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing glioblastoma, which was confirmed histopathologically. The tumor was located in the frontal lobe, and the patient underwent a gross total resection. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was started on adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide. The patient has shown significant improvement in his symptoms, and his KPS has increased to 80.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide as per the treatment plan.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up MRI to monitor for any signs of recurrence.\n",
      "- Neurological evaluation to assess for any cognitive or motor deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade 4 glioblastoma and IDH mutation status are associated with a poor prognosis. However, the complete resection and adjuvant therapy have improved his overall survival and progression-free survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI every 3 months for the first year.\n",
      "- MRI every 6 months for the next 2 years.\n",
      "- Annual neurological evaluation.\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images (T1) reveal a bright, irregular mass with surrounding edema. The T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images (T1c) show a significant enhancement, indicating a highly vascular tumor. The T2-weighted images (T2) show a hyperintense lesion with a well-defined border, consistent with a glioblastoma. The FLAIR images (FLAIR) show a hyperintense lesion with a clear boundary, and the ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, suggesting a highly malignant tumor. The segmentation mask (Seg) accurately delineates the tumor, confirming its extent and location.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately outlines the tumor, showing a well-defined, irregular mass in the left frontal lobe. The mask includes the entire tumor volume, including the enhancing and non-enhancing parts, as well as the surrounding edema. The segmentation is consistent with the MRI images, confirming the diagnosis of a glioblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor, which was completely resected. The extent of resection (EOR) was 100%, and the tumor was completely removed. The surgical approach was well-planned, and the resection was performed with clear margins. The patient's condition was stable, and there were no complications during the surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a glioblastoma, a highly aggressive primary brain tumor. The MRI images showed a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe, with significant enhancement on contrast-enhanced imaging. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor, which was completely resected. The patient's condition was stable, and there were no complications during the surgery. The patient is currently undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Neurological evaluation to assess for any neurological deficits.\n",
      "- Supportive care to manage any side effects of therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's prognosis is guarded due to the aggressive nature of the glioblastoma. The WHO grade 4 and IDH mutant status are unfavorable prognostic factors. The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive outcome. The progression-free survival (PFS) is 649 days, which is also a positive outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging every 3 months for the first year.\n",
      "- Annual follow-up imaging thereafter.\n",
      "- Neurological evaluation every 6 months.\n",
      "- Supportive care to manage any side effects of therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient's KPS was 80 at the time of surgery, which is a good prognostic factor.\n",
      "- The patient's EOR was 100%, which is a positive outcome.\n",
      "- The patient's adjuvant therapy is ongoing, which is a positive factor for prognosis.\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images (T1) reveal a bright, enhancing mass with surrounding edema. The T2-weighted images (T2) show a hyperintense lesion with a well-defined border, indicating a high-grade tumor. The FLAIR images (FLAIR) show a hyperintense lesion with a clear boundary, consistent with the presence of a tumor. The ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, suggesting a solid mass. The segmentation masks (Seg) confirm the presence of a tumor in the left frontal lobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately delineate the tumor, showing a well-circumscribed mass with clear boundaries. The segmentation is consistent across all sequences, indicating a homogeneous tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is well-circumscribed and appears to be accessible for surgical resection. The extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, indicating a complete resection. The tumor is located in the frontal lobe, which is a common site for glioblastoma. The tumor's location and size suggest that a gross total resection (GTR) is feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient is a 65-year-old male with a glioblastoma (WHO grade 4, IDH mutant). The tumor is located in the left frontal lobe and is well-circumscribed. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) and received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). The patient has a good prognosis, with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 649 days and an overall survival (OS) of 736 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue regular follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Regular neurological assessments to monitor for any neurological deficits.\n",
      "- Consider adjuvant therapy as indicated by the clinical team.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade 4 and IDH mutant status are associated with a poor prognosis. However, the patient's complete resection and adjuvant therapy have improved the prognosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI every 3 months for the first year.\n",
      "- MRI every 6 months for the next 2 years.\n",
      "- Annual follow-up with clinical examination and neurological assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient has a good performance status (KPS 80) and a high EOR (100%).\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images reveal a large, irregular mass with a heterogeneous signal intensity, suggesting the presence of necrosis and edema. The T1c images further enhance the lesion, indicating a high vascularity. The T2-weighted images show a hyperintense lesion with a well-defined border, consistent with a glioblastoma. The FLAIR images reveal a large, dark mass with a rim of hyperintensity, which is characteristic of glioblastoma. The ADC images show restricted diffusion, consistent with the malignant nature of the tumor. The segmentation masks confirm the presence of a large, irregular mass in the left frontal lobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately delineate the tumor, showing a well-defined, irregular mass with a heterogeneous signal intensity. The segmentation is consistent with the MRI findings, confirming the presence of a glioblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The surgical resection was extensive, with a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor. The extent of resection (EOR) was 100%, and the tumor was completely removed. The surgical margins were clear, and no residual tumor was detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe, consistent with a glioblastoma. The MRI findings, including the T1, T1c, T2, FLAIR, and ADC images, were consistent with a malignant brain tumor. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor, and the surgical margins were clear. The patient is currently undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue adjuvant RT and TMZ therapy.\n",
      "- Monitor the patient for any signs of recurrence or progression.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging to assess the response to therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's prognosis is guarded, given the high WHO grade and IDH status. The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive outcome. The progression-free survival (PFS) is 649 days, which is also a positive outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging every 3 months for the first year.\n",
      "- Annual follow-up imaging thereafter.\n",
      "- Regular clinical evaluation to assess the patient's response to therapy.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images (T1) reveal a heterogeneous mass with areas of necrosis and calcification. The T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images (T1c) demonstrate a significant enhancement pattern, indicating a highly vascular tumor. The T2-weighted images (T2) show a hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema. The FLAIR images (FLAIR) reveal a hyperintense lesion with a characteristic \"ring-enhancing\" pattern. The ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, consistent with a glioblastoma. The segmentation masks (Seg) accurately delineate the tumor boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks confirm the presence of a glioblastoma with a well-defined boundary. The tumor appears to have a complex structure with areas of necrosis and calcification, which are typical features of glioblastoma. The segmentation analysis supports the diagnosis of a high-grade glioblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The gross total resection (GTR) was achieved with a complete removal of the tumor. The extent of resection (EOR) was 100%, and the tumor was completely resected. The surgical approach was necessary due to the size and location of the tumor, which was causing significant mass effect and midline shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing glioblastoma, which was confirmed by histopathological examination. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) and received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). The patient has shown good response to treatment, with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 649 days and an overall survival (OS) of 736 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue regular follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Regular neurological examination to assess for any neurological deficits.\n",
      "- Regular blood tests to monitor for any side effects of adjuvant therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's prognosis is favorable, given the complete resection and the response to adjuvant therapy. The patient's age and overall health are also favorable prognostic factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI every 3 months for the first year.\n",
      "- MRI every 6 months for the next 2 years.\n",
      "- Annual follow-up with clinical examination and blood tests.\n",

      "#### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images provided show a series of different sequences, each highlighting various aspects of the brain tumor. The T1-weighted image (T1) shows the tumor with a well-defined enhancing mass, indicating a high-grade tumor. The T1-weighted contrast-enhanced image (T1c) further delineates the tumor's borders and shows a significant enhancement, suggesting active blood supply and aggressive growth. The T2-weighted image (T2) shows the tumor as a hyperintense area, consistent with the presence of edema and necrosis. The FLAIR image (FLAIR) shows the tumor as a dark area, indicating the presence of peritumoral edema. The ADC map (ADC) shows restricted diffusion, which is typical for glioblastoma. The segmentation mask (Seg) delineates the tumor's extent, confirming the GTR.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately outlines the tumor, showing a well-defined resection area. The tumor's borders are clearly visible, and the segmentation appears to encompass the entire extent of the tumor, indicating a complete resection.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The images and segmentation data suggest that the tumor was completely resected, which is consistent with the gross total resection (GTR) status. The extent of resection is 100%, and the tumor was completely removed, which is a positive surgical outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a glioblastoma, a highly aggressive and malignant brain tumor. The MRI images show a well-defined enhancing mass, consistent with a high-grade tumor. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor, and the segmentation data confirms the complete resection. The patient's KPS was 80, and the preoperative contrast-enhancing tumor volume was 103.21 cm³, with a T2/FLAIR abnormality of 36.29 cm³. The extent of resection was 100%, and the patient received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- The patient has undergone a complete resection of the glioblastoma, which is a positive outcome.\n",
      "- The patient should continue with adjuvant RT and TMZ therapy as recommended.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up MRI scans are essential to monitor for any recurrence or new lesions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's WHO grade is 4, and the IDH status is mutant, which are both poor prognostic factors. However, the complete resection and adjuvant therapy are positive prognostic factors. The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Regular follow-up MRI scans every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, and annually thereafter.\n",
      "- Regular clinical evaluations to monitor for any neurological deficits or other complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient's KPS was 80, which is a good prognostic factor.\n",
      "- The patient's OS is 736 days, which is a positive outcome.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images provided show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the right frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images (T1) reveal a well-circumscribed mass with a slightly heterogeneous signal. The T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images (T1c) show a marked enhancement, indicating a highly vascular tumor. The T2-weighted images (T2) show a hyperintense lesion with a slightly irregular border. The FLAIR images (FLAIR) show a hyperintense lesion with a well-defined boundary, consistent with the presence of a tumor. The ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, suggesting a solid mass. The segmentation mask (Seg) accurately delineates the tumor, confirming its extent and shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation mask accurately outlines the tumor, showing a well-defined, irregular mass in the right frontal lobe. The segmentation confirms the tumor's size and shape, which is consistent with the MRI images.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The gross total resection (GTR) was performed, and the tumor was completely resected. The extent of resection (EOR) was 100.0%, indicating a complete removal of the tumor. The surgical approach was well-executed, and no residual tumor was detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing, hyperintense lesion in the right frontal lobe, confirmed by MRI imaging. The tumor was highly vascular, as indicated by the contrast-enhanced images. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) and received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue monitoring for any signs of recurrence.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up with MRI to assess for any new lesions.\n",
      "- Maintain a high level of vigilance for any neurological symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive prognostic factor. The progression-free survival (PFS) is 649 days, indicating a favorable response to adjuvant therapy. The WHO grade 4 and IDH mutant status are associated with a poorer prognosis, but the complete resection and adjuvant therapy have contributed to a favorable outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI every 3 months for the first year.\n",
      "- MRI every 6 months for the next 2 years.\n",
      "- Annual MRI thereafter.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images (T1) reveal a bright, irregular mass with surrounding edema. The T1c-weighted images (T1c) show enhancement after contrast, indicating a highly vascular tumor. The T2-weighted images (T2) show a hyperintense lesion with a well-defined border. The FLAIR images (FLAIR) show a hyperintense lesion with a clear boundary, suggesting the presence of edema or necrosis. The ADC images (ADC) show restricted diffusion, indicating a solid mass. The segmentation masks (Seg) highlight the tumor region, which is well-defined and consistent across all sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks accurately delineate the tumor, with clear boundaries and no significant overlap with surrounding brain tissue. The segmentation appears to be precise, with minimal false positives or false negatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The tumor is well-circumscribed and appears to be accessible for surgical resection. The extent of resection (EOR) is 100%, indicating a complete resection. The gross total resection (GTR) suggests that the tumor has been completely removed, which is a positive prognostic factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a large, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe, which was confirmed to be a glioblastoma. The tumor was accessible for surgical resection, and a complete resection was achieved. The patient is currently undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide therapy as per the standard treatment protocol.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence.\n",
      "- Consider additional imaging modalities, such as PET-CT, to assess for any residual disease or metastasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "- The WHO grade of 4 and IDH status of mutant are associated with a poor prognosis.\n",
      "- The extent of resection (100%) and the complete resection (GTR) are positive prognostic factors.\n",
      "- The patient's age and performance status (KPS 80) are also considered in the overall prognosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- Schedule follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess for recurrence.\n",
      "- Consider a PET-CT scan in 6 months to evaluate for any residual disease or metastasis.\n",
      "- Regular clinical follow-up to monitor for any neurological symptoms or signs of recurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive outcome.\n",

      "### Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI images show a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe. The T1-weighted images reveal a large, irregular mass with a heterogeneous signal intensity, suggesting the presence of necrosis and edema. The T1c-weighted images further enhance the lesion, indicating a high vascularity. The T2-weighted images show a hyperintense lesion with a well-defined border, consistent with a glioblastoma. The FLAIR images reveal a large, hyperintense lesion with a significant amount of edema, which is typical for glioblastomas. The ADC images show restricted diffusion, a common feature in glioblastomas. The segmentation masks confirm the presence of a large, irregular mass in the left frontal lobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "The gross total resection (GTR) was achieved with a complete removal of the tumor, as indicated by the 100% extent of resection. The tumor was well-circumscribed, and there was no evidence of positive margins. The surgical approach was through a standard craniotomy, and the resection was performed using a combination of mechanical and ultrasonic dissection techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a rapidly growing, hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe, which was confirmed to be a glioblastoma. The patient underwent a gross total resection (GTR) and received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy. The patient has shown significant improvement in his symptoms, with a good response to treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Continue adjuvant RT and TMZ therapy as per the standard treatment protocol.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up MRI scans to monitor for any recurrence or progression of the tumor.\n",
      "- Neurological evaluation to assess for any cognitive or motor deficits.\n",
      "- Regular follow-up with the oncology team to monitor for any side effects of the treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "The patient's prognosis is generally favorable, given the complete resection of the tumor and the good response to adjuvant therapy. However, the patient's age and the WHO grade of the tumor are significant prognostic factors. The patient's overall survival (OS) is 736 days, which is a positive outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- MRI scans every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2 years.\n",
      "- Neurological evaluation every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2 years.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- The patient has a good KPS score of 80, indicating that he is in good physical condition.\n",
      "- The patient has a good EOR of 100.0, indicating that the tumor was completely resected.\n",
