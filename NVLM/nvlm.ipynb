The tumor demonstrates significant contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images post-contrast administration. The T2-weighted and FLAIR images show extensive peritumoral edema, with the T2/FLAIR abnormality volume measuring 112.88 cm³. The ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) map indicates areas of restricted diffusion within the tumor, suggesting a high cellularity and aggressive nature.\\n\\n## Segmentation Analysis:\\nThe segmentation masks provided in the images confirm the presence of the tumor and its boundaries. The masks highlight the contrast-enhancing regions and the areas of non-enhancing T2/FLAIR abnormality, which are crucial for surgical planning and postoperative assessment.\\n\\n## Surgical Considerations:\\nGiven the gross total resection (GTR) achieved, the surgical team successfully removed the entire visible tumor. The patient's preoperative KPS of 70 indicates a moderate level of functional status, which is a positive factor for postoperative recovery. However, the aggressive nature of glioblastoma necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, including adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide.\\n\\n## Clinical Summary:\\nThe patient is a 72-year-old male diagnosed with a WHO Grade 4 glioblastoma. He underwent surgery with a gross total resection of the tumor. The preoperative imaging shows a significant contrast-enhancing volume and extensive peritumoral edema. The patient is currently undergoing adjuvant therapy with radiotherapy and temozolomide.\\n\\n## Recommendations:\\n1. **Adjuvant Therapy:** Continue with the prescribed course of radiotherapy and temozolomide.\\n2. **Follow-Up Imaging:** Schedule regular MRI scans to monitor for recurrence or progression.\\n3. **Neurological Assessment:** Regular neurological assessments to evaluate functional status and cognitive function.\\n\\n## Prognostic Considerations:\\nThe patient's overall survival of 260 days and progression-free survival of 201 days are within the expected range for glioblastoma. The IDH wild-type status and WHO Grade 4 indicate a poor prognosis, but the extent of resection and adjuvant therapy may provide some benefit.\\n\\n## Follow-Up Plan:\\n- **Initial Follow-Up:** 1 month post-surgery for wound healing and neurological assessment.\\n- **Subsequent Follow-Up:** Every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months thereafter, with MRI scans and clinical evaluations.\\n\\n## Additional Notes:\\nThe patient's age and preoperative KPS are important factors to consider in the management plan. Close monitoring for potential side effects of adjuvant therapy is recommended.\\n\\nA total of 10 images were reviewed for this report.\", [(\"Consider that you are a professional radiologist with several years of experience and you are now treating a patient.

      "## Tumor Characteristics:\n",
      "The MRI scans reveal a large, well-circumscribed mass in the left hemisphere of the brain, consistent with the diagnosis of glioblastoma. The tumor demonstrates significant contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images post-contrast administration, indicative of a high-grade lesion. The T2-weighted and FLAIR images show extensive peritumoral edema, with the abnormality volume measuring 70.83 cm³. The ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) maps suggest areas of restricted diffusion within the tumor, which may correlate with areas of necrosis or high cellularity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Segmentation Analysis:\n",
      "The segmentation masks provided at the bottom row of the images indicate a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor, with no residual enhancing lesions observed post-surgery. The masks confirm the complete removal of the contrast-enhancing portion of the tumor, which aligns with the reported 100% EOR.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Surgical Considerations:\n",
      "Given the patient's age and preoperative KPS of 80, the surgical risk was deemed acceptable. The gross total resection achieved is a favorable outcome, potentially improving the patient's prognosis. However, the presence of extensive peritumoral edema may complicate postoperative management and necessitate close monitoring for signs of increased intracranial pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Clinical Summary:\n",
      "The patient presented with a glioblastoma, WHO grade 4, characterized by a large contrast-enhancing mass with significant surrounding edema. A gross total resection was performed, and the patient received adjuvant therapy consisting of radiotherapy and temozolomide. The patient's progression-free survival was 185 days, and overall survival was 395 days, which is within the expected range for this aggressive tumor type.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations:\n",
      "- **Postoperative Management:** Monitor for signs of recurrence or progression, manage peritumoral edema with appropriate medications, and provide supportive care.\n",
      "- **Follow-Up Imaging:** Regular MRI scans to assess for recurrence or residual disease, initially every 2-3 months post-surgery, then adjusted based on clinical findings.\n",
      "- **Palliative Care:** Consider referral to palliative care services to address pain and other symptoms as the disease progresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prognostic Considerations:\n",
      "Given the patient's age, WHO grade of the tumor, and the presence of extensive edema, the prognosis remains guarded despite the complete resection. The median survival for glioblastoma patients is approximately 15 months, and while the patient's survival exceeds this average, close monitoring and aggressive management of symptoms will be essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Follow-Up Plan:\n",
      "- **Initial Follow-Up:** 2-3 months post-surgery for MRI and clinical evaluation.\n",
      "- **Subsequent Follow-Up:** Every 3-6 months, depending on the patient's condition and imaging results.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Additional Notes:\n",
      "The patient's IDH wild-type status indicates a less favorable prognosis compared to those with IDH mutations. The combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide is the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and adherence to this regimen is crucial for optimizing outcomes.\n",

The tumor demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement, with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The T2/FLAIR images show extensive abnormal signal changes, indicating the presence of edema and possible infiltration into surrounding brain tissue.\\n\\n## Segmentation Analysis:\\nThe segmentation masks provided in the images indicate a well-defined contrast-enhancing region, with a volume of 62.71 cm³. The T2/FLAIR abnormality volume is 115.09 cm³, suggesting a significant area of non-enhancing abnormality, likely representing edema and infiltrative disease.\\n\\n## Surgical Considerations:\\nGiven the high-grade nature of the tumor and the extent of resection achieved (98.2%), the surgical approach was aggressive, aiming for a near-total resection (NTR). The presence of significant peritumoral edema and the location of the tumor may have influenced the surgical strategy, necessitating careful consideration of the balance between maximizing resection and minimizing neurological morbidity.\\n\\n## Clinical Summary:\\nThe patient presented with a high-grade glioblastoma, WHO grade 4, with a wild-type IDH status. The preoperative KPS of 90 indicates a relatively good performance status despite the aggressive nature of the disease. The large contrast-enhancing volume and extensive T2/FLAIR abnormality highlight the aggressive behavior of the tumor.\\n\\n## Recommendations:\\nPostoperatively, the patient should receive adjuvant therapy consisting of radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) to maximize the potential for disease control and improve survival outcomes. Close monitoring for signs of recurrence or progression is essential, with regular follow-up MRI scans recommended.\\n\\n## Prognostic Considerations:\\nGiven the patient's age, WHO grade, and IDH status, the prognosis is guarded. The progression-free survival (PFS) of 112 days and overall survival (OS) of 229 days reflect the aggressive nature of glioblastoma, although the extent of resection may contribute positively to survival outcomes.\\n\\n## Follow-Up Plan:\\nThe patient should undergo regular follow-up with MRI scans every 2-3 months for the first year postoperatively, followed by adjustments based on clinical findings and imaging results.

      "(\"# Radiologist's Report\\n\\n## Patient Information:\\n- *Age:* 47\\n- *Sex:* Male\\n- *Days from earliest imaging to surgery:* 9\\n- *Histopathological Subtype:* Glioblastoma\\n- *WHO Grade:* 4\\n- *IDH Status:* Wild-type (wt)\\n- *Preoperative KPS:* 90\\n- *Preoperative Contrast-Enhancing Tumor Volume (cm³):* 3.7\\n- *Preoperative T2/FLAIR Abnormality (cm³):* 16.74\\n- *Extent of Resection (EOR %):* 94.6\\n- *EOR Type:* Near Total Resection (NTR)\\n- *Adjuvant Therapy:* Radiotherapy (RT) + Temozolomide (TMZ)\\n- *Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Days:* 168\\n- *Overall Survival (OS) Days:* 352\\n\\n## Tumor Characteristics:\\nThe MRI scans show a well-defined, contrast-enhancing lesion consistent with a glioblastoma. The tumor is located in the left frontal lobe, with significant involvement of the surrounding white matter. The T1-weighted images (T1) demonstrate a hypointense area with a central enhancing component. The T1 post-contrast (T1c) images show a marked enhancement, indicating the presence of a blood-brain barrier disruption. The T2-weighted (T2) and FLAIR images reveal extensive peritumoral edema, with the FLAIR sequence providing better visualization of the abnormality. The Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) map shows areas of restricted diffusion, suggesting a high cellularity within the tumor.\\n\\n## Segmentation Analysis:\\nThe segmentation masks at the bottom row of the images indicate the extent of the tumor involvement. The masks highlight the contrast-enhancing region and the surrounding edema, providing a clear delineation of the tumor boundaries. The segmentation analysis confirms the presence of a large, infiltrative tumor with significant peritumoral changes.\\n\\n## Surgical Considerations:\\nGiven the location and extent of the tumor, surgical resection was deemed necessary. The patient underwent a near-total resection (NTR) of the tumor, achieving an EOR of 94.6%. The surgical approach aimed to maximize tumor removal while minimizing neurological deficits, considering the tumor's proximity to eloquent brain areas.\\n\\n## Clinical Summary:\\nThe patient presented with symptoms suggestive of a brain tumor, including headaches and neurological deficits. The MRI findings confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, necessitating prompt surgical intervention.

The tumor is located in the left hemisphere, involving the frontal and parietal lobes, with evidence of mass effect and midline shift. The tumor demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage.\\n\\n## Segmentation Analysis:\\nSegmentation analysis reveals a well-defined contrast-enhancing region with irregular borders, indicative of aggressive tumor growth. The T2/FLAIR images show extensive peritumoral edema, which is typical for glioblastomas. The ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) maps indicate areas of restricted diffusion within the tumor, suggesting high cellularity and aggressive biology.\\n\\n## Surgical Considerations:\\nGiven the large tumor volume and significant mass effect, surgical resection was deemed necessary. A gross total resection (GTR) was achieved, with the extent of resection (EOR) being 100%. The surgical approach involved a left frontoparietal craniotomy, and the resection was guided by intraoperative MRI and neuronavigation to maximize tumor removal while preserving eloquent brain areas.\\n\\n## Clinical Summary:\\nThe patient tolerated the surgery well and was discharged on postoperative day 5. Postoperatively, the patient received adjuvant therapy consisting of radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. The patient's performance status, as measured by the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), was 80 preoperatively, indicating some degree of functional impairment.\\n\\n## Recommendations:\\nGiven the patient's diagnosis of glioblastoma and the aggressive nature of the tumor, it is recommended that the patient continue with the planned adjuvant therapy. Close monitoring with serial MRI scans is advised to assess for any signs of recurrence or progression.

The tumor demonstrates significant contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images post-contrast administration. The T2-weighted and FLAIR images show extensive peritumoral edema, with the FLAIR sequence highlighting the abnormality more clearly. The ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) map indicates areas of restricted diffusion within the tumor, suggesting a high cellularity typical of glioblastoma.\\n\\n## Segmentation Analysis:\\nThe segmentation masks provided at the bottom row of the images confirm the presence of the tumor and its boundaries. The masks accurately delineate the contrast-enhancing regions and the areas of non-enhancing abnormality, which correlate with the T2/FLAIR findings. The segmentation analysis supports the diagnosis of a high-grade glioma, specifically glioblastoma, given the aggressive nature and rapid growth indicated by the imaging.\\n\\n## Surgical Considerations:\\nGiven the preoperative contrast-enhancing tumor volume of 36.91 cm³ and the T2/FLAIR abnormality volume of 24.34 cm³, the surgical team elected for a gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor. The EOR of 100% indicates a successful surgical intervention, which is crucial for improving survival outcomes in patients with glioblastoma. The presence of significant peritumoral edema suggests the need for careful postoperative management to mitigate potential neurological complications.\\n\\n## Clinical Summary:\\nThe patient is a 78-year-old female with a diagnosis of glioblastoma (WHO Grade 4) confirmed by histopathological examination. The preoperative imaging shows a large, enhancing mass with significant surrounding edema. The patient underwent a gross total resection of the tumor, and adjuvant therapy with radiotherapy and temozolomide was initiated postoperatively.

The tumor demonstrates significant contrast enhancement on the T1-weighted post-contrast images (T1c) and hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating the presence of edema and necrosis within the tumor. The Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) map shows areas of restricted diffusion, which may correlate with areas of high cellularity within the tumor.\\n\\n## Segmentation Analysis:\\nThe segmentation masks provided in the images indicate the extent of the tumor involvement. The masks show a well-defined contrast-enhancing region, with additional non-enhancing areas suggesting necrosis or edema. The segmentation analysis confirms the large volume of the tumor, with a significant portion affecting the surrounding brain parenchyma.\\n\\n## Surgical Considerations:\\nGiven the large size and location of the tumor, subtotal resection was performed, achieving an EOR of 99.5%.

The patient underwent subtotal resection, followed by adjuvant therapy consisting of radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. Despite the aggressive treatment, the patient's progression-free survival was relatively short, at 56 days, and overall survival was 90 days.\\n\\n## Recommendations:\\nGiven the aggressive nature of glioblastoma and the patient's limited survival, palliative care should be considered. Close monitoring for recurrence or progression of the disease is recommended, with regular follow-up MRI scans.\\n\\n## Prognostic Considerations:\\nThe patient's age, wild-type IDH status, and subtotal resection are all poor prognostic factors for survival in glioblastoma patients. The short progression-free survival indicates a rapid disease progression, which is typical for this aggressive tumor type.\\n\\n## Follow-Up Plan:\\nThe patient should undergo regular follow-up with MRI scans every 2-3 months to monitor for recurrence or progression of the disease. Clinical assessments should also be performed to evaluate the patient's neurological status and overall well-being.\\n\\n## Additional Notes:\\nThe patient's overall survival of 90 days is within the expected range for glioblastoma patients, particularly those with subtotal resection and wild-type IDH status.

The tumor exhibits a significant contrast-enhancing volume of 103.21 cm³ and a T2/FLAIR abnormality volume of 36.29 cm³, indicating extensive involvement of the brain parenchyma.\\n\\n## Segmentation Analysis:\\nThe segmentation analysis reveals a well-defined contrast-enhancing region with irregular borders, suggesting areas of necrosis and hemorrhage within the tumor. The T2/FLAIR images show a hyperintense signal, indicative of edema and peritumoral changes. The ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) maps demonstrate areas of restricted diffusion, which may correlate with areas of high cellularity within the tumor.\\n\\n## Surgical Considerations:\\nGiven the large preoperative contrast-enhancing tumor volume and the presence of significant T2/FLAIR abnormalities, surgical resection was deemed necessary.
