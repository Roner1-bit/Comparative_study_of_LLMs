("# Radiologist's Report\n\n## Patient Information:\n- **Age:** 65\n- **Sex:** Male\n- **Days from earliest imaging to surgery:** 1\n- **Histopathological Subtype:** Glioblastoma\n- **WHO Grade:** 4\n- **IDH Status:** Mutant\n- **Preoperative KPS:** 80\n- **Preoperative Contrast-Enhancing Tumor Volume (cm³):** 103.21\n- **Preoperative T2/FLAIR Abnormality (cm³):** 36.29\n- **Extent of Resection (EOR %):** 100.0\n- **EOR Type:** Gross Total Resection (GTR)\n- **Adjuvant Therapy:** Radiotherapy (RT) + Temozolomide (TMZ)\n- **Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Days:** 649\n- **Overall Survival (OS) Days:** 736\n\n## Tumor Characteristics:\nThe MRI scans reveal a large, well-circumscribed mass in the left frontal lobe, consistent with the diagnosis of glioblastoma. The tumor demonstrates significant contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images post-contrast administration. The T2-weighted and FLAIR images show extensive peritumoral edema, with the FLAIR sequence highlighting the abnormality more clearly. The ADC map indicates areas of restricted diffusion within the tumor, suggesting a high cellularity and aggressive nature.\n\n## Segmentation Analysis:\nSegmentation analysis of the MRI scans indicates a total tumor volume of approximately 103.21 cm³, with a significant portion of the tumor demonstrating contrast enhancement. The segmentation masks confirm the presence of the tumor and its extension into surrounding brain parenchyma.\n\n## Surgical Considerations:\nGiven the gross total resection (GTR) achieved during surgery, the patient's postoperative recovery should be closely monitored. The extent of resection is favorable for improving survival outcomes, but the aggressive nature of glioblastoma necessitates a multidisciplinary approach to management.\n\n## Clinical Summary:\nThe patient is a 65-year-old male diagnosed with glioblastoma (WHO Grade 4) with an IDH wild-type status. He underwent surgery achieving a gross total resection of the tumor. Postoperatively, he received adjuvant therapy consisting of radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. His progression-free survival is 649 days, and overall survival is 736 days, which is within the expected range for this aggressive tumor type.\n\n## Recommendations:\n1. **Follow-Up Imaging:** Regular MRI scans every 3 months for the first year post-surgery to monitor for recurrence.\n2. **Neurological Assessment:** Regular neurological assessments to evaluate for any deficits or changes in cognitive function.\n3. **Supportive Care:** Provide supportive care, including pain management and psychological support, to address the patient's needs during recovery.\n\n## Prognostic Considerations:\nThe patient's overall survival and progression-free survival are encouraging, but the aggressive nature of glioblastoma necessitates continued vigilance. The IDH wild-type status and the extent of resection are critical factors in determining prognosis.\n\n## Follow-Up Plan:\n- **Initial Follow-Up:** 3 months post-surgery\n- **Subsequent Follow-Up:** Every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months thereafter\n- **Neuro-oncology Clinic:** Regular visits to the neuro-oncology clinic for ongoing management and support.\n\n## Additional Notes:\nThe patient's preoperative KPS of 80 indicates a relatively good performance status, which is a positive factor for tolerating adjuvant therapy.

The tumor is located in the left hemisphere, involving the frontal and parietal lobes, with significant mass effect and midline shift. The enhancing component of the tumor is heterogeneous, with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage noted.\n\n## Segmentation Analysis:\nSegmentation analysis of the MRI images reveals a well-defined contrast-enhancing lesion with irregular borders. The T2/FLAIR images show extensive peritumoral edema, which is typical for glioblastomas. The ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) maps indicate areas of restricted diffusion within the tumor, suggesting a high cellularity and aggressive nature. The segmentation masks confirm the presence of the tumor and its extent within the brain parenchyma.\n\n## Surgical Considerations:\nGiven the large size and location of the tumor, surgical resection was deemed necessary.

The tumor is located in the left frontal lobe, with significant surrounding edema as evidenced by the T2/FLAIR images. The ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) map indicates areas of restricted diffusion within the tumor, suggesting a high cellularity and aggressive nature.\n\n## Segmentation Analysis:\nSegmentation masks reveal a total resection of the contrast-enhancing tumor, with no residual enhancing tissue post-surgery. The T2/FLAIR abnormality volume is significantly reduced postoperatively, indicating effective debulking of the tumor.\n\n## Surgical Considerations:\nGiven the gross total resection (GTR) achieved, the surgical team successfully removed all visible tumor tissue. The patient's preoperative KPS of 90 indicates a relatively good performance status, which likely contributed to the successful surgical outcome.\n\n## Clinical Summary:\nThe patient presented with a glioblastoma WHO grade 4, characterized by a contrast-enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe.

("# Radiologist's Report\n\n## Patient Information:\n- **Age:** 72\n- **Sex:** Male\n- **Days from earliest imaging to surgery:** 3\n- **Histopathological Subtype:** Glioblastoma\n- **WHO Grade:** 4\n- **IDH Status:** Wild-type (wt)\n- **Preoperative KPS:** 70\n- **Preoperative Contrast-Enhancing Tumor Volume (cm³):** 65.82\n- **Preoperative T2/FLAIR Abnormality (cm³):** 112.88\n- **Extent of Resection (EOR %):** 100.0\n- **EOR Type:** Gross Total Resection (GTR)\n- **Adjuvant Therapy:** Radiotherapy (RT) + Temozolomide (TMZ)\n- **Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Days:** 201\n- **Overall Survival (OS) Days:** 260\n\n## Tumor Characteristics:\nThe MRI scans reveal a large, well-circumscribed mass in the left hemisphere of the brain, consistent with a glioblastoma. The tumor demonstrates significant contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images post-contrast administration. The T2-weighted and FLAIR images show extensive peritumoral edema, with the T2/FLAIR abnormality volume measuring 112.88 cm³. The ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) map indicates areas of restricted diffusion within the tumor, suggesting a high cellularity and aggressive nature.\n\n## Segmentation Analysis:\nThe segmentation masks provided in the images confirm the presence of the tumor and its boundaries. The masks highlight the contrast-enhancing regions and the areas of non-enhancing T2/FLAIR abnormality, which are crucial for surgical planning and postoperative assessment.\n\n## Surgical Considerations:\nGiven the gross total resection (GTR) achieved, the surgical team successfully removed the entire visible tumor. The patient's preoperative KPS of 70 indicates a moderate level of functional status, which is a positive factor for postoperative recovery. However, the aggressive nature of glioblastoma necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, including adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide.\n\n## Clinical Summary:\nThe patient is a 72-year-old male diagnosed with a WHO Grade 4 glioblastoma. He underwent surgery with a gross total resection of the tumor. The preoperative imaging shows a significant contrast-enhancing volume and extensive peritumoral edema. The patient is currently undergoing adjuvant therapy with radiotherapy and temozolomide.\n\n## Recommendations:\n1. **Adjuvant Therapy:** Continue with the prescribed course of radiotherapy and temozolomide.\n2. **Follow-Up Imaging:** Schedule regular MRI scans to monitor for recurrence or progression.\n3. **Neurological Assessment:** Regular neurological assessments to evaluate functional status and cognitive function.\n\n## Prognostic Considerations:\nThe patient's overall survival of 260 days and progression-free survival of 201 days are within the expected range for glioblastoma. The IDH wild-type status and WHO Grade 4 indicate a poor prognosis, but the extent of resection and adjuvant therapy may provide some benefit.\n\n## Follow-Up Plan:\n- **Initial Follow-Up:** 1 month post-surgery for wound healing and neurological assessment.\n- **Subsequent Follow-Up:** Every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months thereafter, with MRI scans and clinical evaluations.\n\n## Additional Notes:\nThe patient's age and preoperative KPS are important factors to consider in the management plan. Close monitoring for potential side effects of adjuvant therapy is recommended.\n\nA total of 10 images were reviewed for this report.", [("Consider that you are a professional radiologist with several years of experience and you are now treating a patient.
